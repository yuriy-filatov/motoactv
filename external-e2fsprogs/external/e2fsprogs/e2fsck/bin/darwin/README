The binary available in this folder is used for Mac OS builds only (v.1.41.12).
It was done under CR IKMAIN-1686 to fix Segmentation Fault issue experienced on Mac computers.
As soon as we have update of e2fsprogs from Google (expected in Gingerbread), it needs to be
reverted to the state how it worked before (i.e., building e2fsck from source).
